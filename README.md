## Exercise 1
1. Luminosity Method: This uses the coefficients 0.2989 for Red, 0.5870 for Green, and 0.1140 for Blue, which takes into account the human eye's sensitivity to these colors. Generally yields a more visually accurate grayscale representation as it adjusts for human perception.
2. Average Method: Tends to produce a slightly washed-out or less contrasted image since it doesn't consider the varying sensitivity of human vision to different colors.

## Exercise 2
I've used KMeans for color quantization.

The color quantization has been successfully applied to the resized version of the image, significantly reducing the number of colors to 16, as displayed above.
